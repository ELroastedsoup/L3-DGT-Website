			<h1>Compose Dance Sequences for Given Briefs</h1>
			<p>
				In this standard it is required that 3 dance sequences are choreographed to communicate three separate
				briefs.
				<br />
				<br />
				Brief 1: Opposite words, which it is required that you work in a pair. The teacher will supply the
				student with the opposite words which will be used.
				<br />
				<br />
				Brief 2: Chance Dance, which it is required that you work in groups of 3-4.
				<br />
				<br />
				Brief 3: Urban VS Nature, which it is required that you work in groups of 3-4.
				<br />
				<br />
				In these briefs it is required that you can choreograph any style of dance as long as it uses the theme
				of the brief and that all members of the group contribute ideas.

			<h1>Techniques for Achieved</h1>
			<p>
				To gain achieved it is required that, the motif is evident for example there is evidence of a developing
				vocabulary of movement. The sequence shoes appropriate use of variations for example the use of two
				choreographic devices that manipulate the original motif. You could consider using:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-top: 5%">
				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Locomotor and non-locomotor movements</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Still shapes at the start and beginning of dance</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Non-unison movement</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Pathways (horizontal lines, zigzag lines, etc.)</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Dynamics</li>

			<h1>Techniques for Merit</h1>
			<p>
				To gain merit it is required that, the motif is effective for example there is evidence of a developing
				movement in relation to the vocabulary. The sequence shows effective variations for example the use of
				two choreographic devices that effectively manipulate the original motif. You could consider using:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-top: 5%">Effective variation in locomotor and non-locomotor movement and repetition</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%;">
					Still shapes at the beginning and end of dance that reflect the words and contain varying body parts
					and levels</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top: 5%;">Non-unison movement</li>
			</ul>

		<!--column for excellence techniques-->
		<div class="columnrightmain" style="padding-top: 40%">
			<h1>Techniques for Excelence</h1>
			<p>
				To gain excellence it is required that, the motif is imaginative for example shows evidence of the
				ability to combine movement in unexpected ways which relate to the opposite words. The sequence shows
				imaginative use of variations for example the use of two choreographic decides that imaginatively
				manipulate the motif. You could consider using:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-top: 5%">
				<li style="margin-top: 5%">
					Imaginative locomotor and non-locomotor movements that are unexpected or unusual and that are
					variated in repetition
				</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%;">
					Still shapes at the beginning and end of the dance that reflect the opposite words and are shapes
					performed at two levels (contrasting body shaped and bases.)
				</li>

				<li style="margin-top: 5%;">Non-unison movement</li>
