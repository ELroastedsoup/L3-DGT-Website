		<p>The student will perform three dance sequences from different genres. Each sequence must be at least 45 seconds long.  
			<br>

			Sequence 1: Jazz. The Jazz sequence will be dynamic and sharp, you will be assessed on your jazz technique (turns, jumps, etc.)
			<br>
			<br>
			Sequence 2: Lyrical. The lyrical dance will be emotional. You will be assessed on your ability to perform smooth and sharp contrasts with the music as well as control and clarity.

			Sequence 3: Tap. The tap dance will be focused on your percussion. You will be assessed on your ability to perform clarity of beats as well as musicality (facials, energy shifts, dynamics.)
